# Quantum Annealing Monte Carlo Tools

This is a library of standrd Monte Carlo tools used to approximate the behaviour of quantum annealers. Example use of the models is found in ```testing.jl```.

There are also a list of models that rely on numeric integrators, and require additional packages to be installed correctly.
